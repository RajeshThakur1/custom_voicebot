Hereâ€™s the overall logic of the RBAC project structure we set up:

1. rbacapp/main.py**  
This is the FastAPI entry point. It creates the app, includes all routers (auth, todos, admin, users), and sets up any middleware or startup events.

2. rbacapp/models/**  
Contains SQLAlchemy ORM models that map to database tables (e.g., `User`, `Role`, `Todo`). These define the database schema and relationships.

3. rbacapp/schemas/**  
Holds Pydantic models (`schemas`) that define the data shapes for request validation and response formatting, separate from the database models. Example: `TodoCreate` for POST payloads, `TodoResponse` for API responses.

4. rbacapp/routers/**  
Contains the route logic for different domains:
- **auth.py**: Handles authentication, login, token creation.
- **users.py**: CRUD operations for users, role assignments.
- **admin.py**: Admin-only routes for managing roles, permissions.
- **todos.py**: CRUD for todos, protected by role-based access.

5. rbacapp/utils/**  
Helper functions such as password hashing, JWT token creation, and permission checks.

6. rbacapp/database.py**  
Sets up the database connection and session handling for SQLAlchemy.

**RBAC Flow:**
1. User logs in via `auth.py`, gets JWT with embedded role info.
2. Protected routes check the token and role before processing.
3. Models persist data, schemas validate input/output.
4. Admin routes allow role management.



simple_rbac_test.py likely contains unit tests for core RBAC logic (e.g., role checks, permission assignment).

test_rbac_system.py probably performs integration-level tests (e.g., simulate a login, token issuance, access control flow).
